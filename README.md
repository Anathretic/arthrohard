## About

This is a recruitment task for one of the companies I applied to. I enjoyed the whole assignment and managed to add a few 'extras', keeping in line with the mock-up.

## Features that I would add

1. Certainly when displaying a popup in the product section, overflow:hidden would be useful.

2. Adding an error 404 subpage to handle url errors.

## Duration of work

1. Prepare project and thinking about structure/ideas - 1h 45 min
2. Navbar - 25 min
3. Welcome section - 35 min
4. What Sets Us Apart section - 40 min
5. Composition section - 1h 15 min
6. Products section with popup - 50 min
7. Debugging and improvements - 1h 35 min
8. Extras - 25 min

**Total:** 7h 30 min
